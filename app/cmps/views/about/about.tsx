          This is an experimental gallery designed to visualize tens of
          thousands of images as a Voronoi diagram. The Voronoi seeds are
          generated using a custom grid-constrained force graph layout. The
          simulation layer runs in JavaScript with multithreading support, while
          the visualization layer uses WebGL2.

          to art and architecture. While they’re aesthetically pleasing, they
          haven’t traditionally had a strong use case in user interfaces. This
          is an attempt to give them one - though admittedly, a similar effect
          could be achieved by simply distorting a grid.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It’s worth noting that this is not a typical Voronoi diagram. The
          seeds are loosely constrained to a grid, which makes the resulting
          cells fairly uniform. The distance metric is biased 1.5x along the
          y-axis. Depending on the view mode, there are also cell weights and
          various distortion effects.

          The force simulation runs on the CPU in a JavaScript web worker. It's
          heavily inspired by{' '}

        <p>
          The simulation could potentially be implemented on the GPU with WebGL
          - though WebGPU would be a better fit once it gains broader adoption.

          Alternatively, potential performance gains could be achieved by

          is not employed. Instead, the Voronoi diagram is generated in a single
          pass through a two-pronged approach: comparing distances with
          immediate grid neighbors and with additional neighbors located within
          a small pixel-radius search area. Although cell propagation is
          relatively slow, this can be reasonably masked using simulation speed
          limits and other visual tricks.
